## 🎯 Vision & Purpose

This project represents more than just a blog platform—it's an educational journey from a functional blog (ozxk-dev) to an ambitious edge-native application (ouzx.me). Built with transparency at its core, it serves as:

- 📚 A learning resource for enterprise-grade architecture
- 🔬 A living laboratory for modern development practices
- 🌐 A showcase of edge-native capabilities
- 🤝 An open platform for collaboration and knowledge sharing

## 🏗️ Technical Foundation

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Hono
- **Infrastructure**: Cloudflare Edge
- **Package Management**: pnpm and turborepo (Monorepo structure)
- **Project Management**: GitHub Projects

## 💡 Project Philosophy

This platform is built as an open learning experience, documenting the entire journey from conception to implementation. Every decision, challenge, and solution is transparently shared, making it a valuable resource for developers interested in:

- Edge computing architecture
- Modern JavaScript frameworks
- Enterprise-grade development practices
- Project management methodologies
- Open-source collaboration

## 🔄 Development Approach

The project follows a systematic, educational approach where:

- Each feature addition is properly documented
- Development decisions are explained
- Best practices are demonstrated
- Real-world patterns are prioritized over theoretical implementations
- Community collaboration is encouraged

The entire development process, including project management and documentation, is open source, allowing developers to:

- Follow along with the development journey
- Understand architectural decisions
- Learn from practical implementations
- Contribute to the platform's evolution
